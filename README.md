[00:09.36] 
[00:08.29] Got your message, said, "We're leaving right now" (right now)
[00:11.94] You was hopin' that I wouldn't find out (wouldn't find out)
[00:15.37] Didn't know for sure, but know I had my doubts
[00:17.97] And now the night's strung out, baby, you'd just end up
[00:45.47] 
[00:22.56] Dancin' with somebody, please never remind me
[00:25.74] That one point in my life I ever wanted you by me
[00:30.16] She pretty, but she conniving, giant waste of my time and
[00:33.64] Always leaving me crying, for some reason I like it (baby, you'd just end up)

[00:49.02] Always leaving me crying, for some reason I like it
[01:14.52] 
[00:52.69] Truth be told, I ain't doing too well
[00:54.56] Oh no, girl, I don't need your help
[00:56.02] My brain feel dead, can't believe myself
[00:58.24] You can't use me just to please yourself
[01:18.24] 
[01:00.42] I tried to hide from the truth
[01:02.48] I end up hiding from you
[01:04.20] I'll jump through hurdles, do circles
[01:05.60] But you won't give me a clue
[01:19.60] 
[01:08.30] But that's all from me
[01:09.43] Heard you got somethin' you can offer me
[01:10.64] Bad reputation, heard awful things
[01:12.99] I'ma just end up groveling
[01:14.46] Better let me pop my shit
[01:16.35] D.O. ain't no stoppin' him
[01:18.00] No, me and you not lockin' in
[01:20.29] You can watch how quick we turn to friends
[01:41.29] 
[01:22.22] The life you're involved in, I'm never an option
[01:26.19] The loss of your love's just a nail in a coffin
[01:29.75] I was careful, I was cautious, your presence is a toxin
[01:33.52] I knew it when you walked in, baby, you'd just end up
[02:00.02]
